# Mox Language 

A new, general purpose language that takes inspiration from Elm, Elixir and Ocaml.

## Philosophy

- Code aesthetics matter
- Compilers should help produce better code, not block you
- Built-in support for handling failures
- Readability over cleverness
- Thoughtful design over compromises
